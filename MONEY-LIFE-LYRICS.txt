Money...
Yeah. This fucking paper that we work for, all of your life.
This fucking paper that you can't live without. This fucking paper that you are constantly in lack.

Yeah.

May all the slaves of this shit stand up, and never be again what we call "slave of this shit of money". Because we are not made for money. 
We are humans, because we are made blood. We are not made for this shit, bullshit, we are made for life and life hasn't to be for money, and money hasn't to be for life.

This will change.
Yeah.
This will change.

Your life is not made for it. And it isn't made for you.

Fuck money.

Fuck this green bullshit that has contaminated the whole world.
And yeah, without money you still alive.
