ðŸŽ¼Carpe diem philosophy song lyrics

Three, two, one. Let's go.
Breath.
What did you do all these past years ?
What for ? 
What for ? 
All that work, all that that suffering time. 

Enjoy life. 

Tommorow all ends, all ends, all ends. 

Enjoy life. 

Do not seek anymore for money, do not seek anymore for love, do not seek anymore for amusement, do not seek anymore for food. 

Enjoy life. 

Yeah. Yeah. Seek now for yourself, for your own benefits, for your own life. 

Enjoy life. 

You deserve more than all this shits. 

Enjoy life. 

Believe me, you are the unique pearl that the world has. 

Enjoy life. 

Without you, no matter your social status, no matter who you are, the world cannot stand anymore.
